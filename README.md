Rock Paper Scissors game using Javascript

Project for The Odin Project, will be written inside HTML document using script tag.

The problem:
   Write a program that takes a users input of either rock, paper or scissors, and compares it to the computer's random choice of rock paper scissor's. The program will take the user's input and assign it as either number 1, 2 or 3, and the same with the computer's random choice. The program will show the user the computer's output of either rock, paper or, scissors. If the user's input beats the computers, it will tell the user he has won. If the input did not, it will tell the user it lost. If the input is the same as the computer's, it will tell the user its a tie. This will go through 5 rounds, and at the end whoever has the greatest amount of win's will be told they win the game.
